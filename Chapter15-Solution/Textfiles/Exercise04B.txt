Line 1: The best G-SYNC gaming monitor we've tested so far is the ASUS ROG Swift PG279QZ.
Line 2: It has an extremely fast response time that delivers crisp motion in fast paced-games, and a very low input lag for a very responsive gaming experience.
Line 3: It features a flicker-free backlight to help avoid eye-strain but supports NVIDIA's ultra-low motion blur (ULMB) technology that allows it to introduce flicker to help the appearance of motion.
The overall picture quality is decent with a peak brightness that's good enough for most rooms, but not enough for very bright ones.
Line 5: It has good, wide viewing angles that favor co-op gaming and supports G-SYNC variable refresh rate technology for nearly tear-free gaming.
Line 6: Gamers will also enjoy the great selection of gaming enhancing features like the optional crosshair or the FPS counter.
Unfortunately, just like most IPS monitors, it isn't the best choice if you regularly game at night or in a dark room, since blacks look more like gray.
Line 8: This monitor is nearly identical to the ASUS ROG Swift PG279Q, so you should choose whichever is cheaper.
Line 9: m
Line 10: Overall, this is a very good monitor that delivers an excellent gaming experience, especially if you own an NVIDIA graphics card where you'll take advantage of the G-SYNC support.
