Line 1: LG 27GL83A-B
Line 2: The LG 27GL83A-B is a good 1440p IPS monitor with great gaming performance.
Line 3: It has a remarkably fast response time that delivers fast-moving content with almost no blur trail, and an outstanding low input lag for very responsive gaming sessions.
Line 4: Also, this monitor supports FreeSync variable refresh rate technology and is G-SYNC compatible, offering a nearly tear-free gaming experience.
Line 5: The outstanding feature of this monitor is motion handling.
Line 6: The LG 27GL83A-B can get fairly bright, suitable for most rooms, and supports HDR, although it can't get very bright in that mode.
Line 7: Unfortunately, this monitor can't display deep blacks in a dark room due to the low contrast ratio, so it's not a good choice for late-night gaming.
